It  the best of times,   the worst of times,   the age of wisdom,
  the age of foolishness,   the epoch of belief,   the epoch of increduly,
  the season of Light,   the season of Darkness,
  the spring of hope,   the winter of despair,
we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.xxxx   zzzzz
